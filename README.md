# Neural-Machine-Translation-German-to-English-
**Overview**
This project implements a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate text from one language to another. The model leverages sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) units, enhanced by attention mechanisms, to improve the quality of translations. The project uses Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and other NLP techniques to train and deploy the translation model.
**Features**
Encoder-Decoder Architecture: The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture to process and generate translations.
Attention Mechanism: Attention is applied to help the model focus on important words during the translation process.
Preprocessing Pipeline: Text data is tokenized, cleaned, and processed for training and inference.
Training with Parallel Corpus: The model is trained using parallel corpora (pairs of sentences in source and target languages).
Translation Interface: The system provides an interface to input text and get translations in real-time
**Technologies Used**
Python 3.x: The primary programming language used for the implementation of the project.
PyTorch: Deep learning framework used to define and train the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model.
NumPy: Used for numerical computations and data manipulations.
NLTK: Used for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.
Flask/FastAPI: Used to deploy the trained model as a RESTful API for serving translation requests.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the training loss/accuracy during model training.
TorchText: For text preprocessing and tokenization in PyTorch.
CUDA: Used for GPU acceleration (if available).
