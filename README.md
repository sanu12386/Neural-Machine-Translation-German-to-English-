# Neural-Machine-Translation-German-to-English-
**Overview**
This project implements a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate text from one language to another. The model leverages sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) units, enhanced by attention mechanisms, to improve the quality of translations. The project uses Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and other NLP techniques to train and deploy the translation model.



**Features**
Encoder-Decoder Architecture: The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture to process and generate translations.

Attention Mechanism: Attention is applied to help the model focus on important words during the translation process.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Text data is tokenized, cleaned, and processed for training and inference.

Training with Parallel Corpus: The model is trained using parallel corpora (pairs of sentences in source and target languages).

Translation Interface: The system provides an interface to input text and get translations in real-time.



**Technologies Used**
Python 3.x: The primary programming language used for the implementation of the project.

PyTorch: Deep learning framework used to define and train the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model.

NumPy: Used for numerical computations and data manipulations.

NLTK: Used for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.

Flask/FastAPI: Used to deploy the trained model as a RESTful API for serving translation requests.

Matplotlib: For visualizing the training loss/accuracy during model training.

TorchText: For text preprocessing and tokenization in PyTorch.

CUDA: Used for GPU acceleration (if available).

**Seq2Se2 Model Analysis**

The Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model is a type of neural network architecture used for tasks where the input and output are sequences of variable length, such as in machine translation, speech recognition, and summarization. This model is based on the Encoder-Decoder architecture, where both the encoder and decoder are typically implemented using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells.


**Encoder (LSTM):**

The encoder takes the input sequence (such as a sentence in the source language) and processes it step-by-step using an LSTM cell.

At each time step, the LSTM receives an input token (usually word embeddings) and updates its internal hidden state.

The final hidden state and cell state of the encoder, which summarize the entire input sequence, are passed to the decoder. This step is critical for the decoder to learn context from the input sequence.

**Decoder (LSTM):**

The decoder generates the output sequence (such as the translated sentence in the target language). It is fed with the encoderâ€™s final hidden and cell states, which provide the context learned from the input sequence.

The decoder also uses an LSTM cell to generate output tokens step-by-step. At each time step, the LSTM receives the previous token (or the predicted token during inference) and outputs the next token in the sequence.
